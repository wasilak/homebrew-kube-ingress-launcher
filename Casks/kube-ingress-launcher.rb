  caveats <<~EOS
    Kube Ingress Launcher is an unsigned application. You'll need to bypass macOS Gatekeeper:
    
    1. Try to open the application from /Applications
    2. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security
    3. Click "Open Anyway" in the Security section
    4. Confirm by clicking "Open"
    
    For detailed instructions, see:
    https://github.com/wasilak/kube-ingress-launcher/blob/main/docs/GATEKEEPER_BYPASS.md
    
    The application requires Accessibility permission for the global keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+K).
